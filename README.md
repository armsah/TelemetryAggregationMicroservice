Project Name: Fault-Tolerant Telemetry Aggregation Microservice
This is a system that collects and processes data (telemetry) from many network devices — things like routers, sensors, or IoT devices — and makes sure it keeps running even if something goes wrong.

Main Goal
•	Keeps working even if parts of it fail.
•	Can handle lots of incoming data.
•	Uses the right tools for each job (SQL + NoSQL).
